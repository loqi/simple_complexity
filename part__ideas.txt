Linear Visiting nodes: n/2 + n/4 + n/8 + ... = n
O(log number) is O(number.toString.length)
Tiny heap vs. sorted array
Amortized vs. immediate computational work (queue of two stacks)
Local rotation of trees.
Tree implemented through time, not just in memory.

bogo sort - O(n!) even with array walk for sort checking.
sleep 12 days is constant. So is sleep random time up to 12 days.
